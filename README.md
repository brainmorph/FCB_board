# FCB_board
Version 2 of flight control board initially developed in the "Flight Controller" repo.

Custom flight control firmware for STM32F407 (my attempt at flight control for educational purposes)

See this firmware in action! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjNGKUeZyxY

NOTE: This project is currently in prototype phase where the main objective is proof of concept for various flight operations. That being said, the ultimate goal is to extend the usability of the architecture developed here and scale to other flight platforms.
